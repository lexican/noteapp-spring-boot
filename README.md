# Note App

This Note App is built with Spring Boot and demostrates how CRUD APIs work

<br>

## Features

- Implement create note
- Implement update note by note Id
- Implement edit note by Id
- Imlement delete note by Id
- Used Lombok to make model classes more robust
- Used spring boot starter validation to handle validation

Note : I did not use any database to persist the notes for simplicity.

- Any Operating System (ie. MacOS X, Linux, Windows)
- Any IDE with Java SDK installed (ie IntelliJ, Eclipse, Spring Suite Tool etc)
- A little knowledge of Java and Spring Boot
